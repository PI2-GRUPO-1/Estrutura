# Summary

I designed a game holder for the purpose of holding my games! I hope you enjoy it. 

Depending on the tolerance of your printer or material used (I used PLA) you may have to sand the tabs that connect the front to the tray to make it fit better. Also, use some superglue on the tabs to ensure the parts don't come apart. Its best to use a higher infill percentage on the tray to make the walls sturdier. 

Anybody is welcome to remix it. If someone wants to make some indents on the bottom to make it stackable that'd be great. If you end up printing my design, please post a picture as I would love to see it!

Enjoy
